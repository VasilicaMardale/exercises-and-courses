                        <p><strong>Camembert</strong> is a soft cows’ milk cheese with a furry white rind speckled with
                            beige, and a creamy, pale interior which becomes increasingly yellow as the cheese matures.
                            The best examples are usually made from raw milk, but most mass-produced camemberts are now
                            pasteurised.
                            When fully ripe, camembert has a pungent, strongly-flavoured and runny interior somewhat
                            similar to the milder brie. Unlike brie, which is produced in large flat wheels, camembert
                            is made in individual cheeses about 11cm/4.5in in diameter.
                            Marie Harel created the original Camembert cheese from raw milk in Normandy, France in 1791.
                            Today, however, a very small percentage of producers make cheese from raw milk with the same
                            process as Marie Harel would have used. Those who produce cheese using Marie Harel's method,
                            can legally call their cheese Camembert Normandie under the AOC guidelines. However, the
                            production of Camembert cheese has now transcended the AOC designation. Very good varieties
                            of Camembert cheese made from pasteurised milk can be found in Normandy today. The best of
                            them is the Camembert Le Châtelain.
                            The fresh Camembert cheese is bland, hard and crumbly in texture. Young Camembert has a
                            milky and sweet taste. As the cheese matures it forms a smooth, runny interior and a white
                            bloomy rind that is typical to Camenbert cheese. It has a rich, buttery flavour. The rind is
                            bloomy white caused by a white fungus, called penicillium candidum.The rind is meant to be
                            eaten with the cheese.
                            <em>This cheese is best paired with a light red wine such as Beaujolais, Chenin Blanc, St
                                Emilion, St Estephe or traditionally a glass of Normandy cider. </em>

                        <p><strong>Vulscombe Goats Cheese</strong> is a soft, fresh, pasteurised, goats’ milk cheese
                            made without rennet and is therefore suitable for vegetarians. It is produced near
                            Tiverton by Joyce and Graham Townsend. Unlike many other soft cheeses, it is
                            pressed for 24 hours to reduce the moisture content. This contributes to its
                            rich, creamy, mild flavour and its keeping quality. The milk is from a fine
                            herd of goats on a small farm in the beautiful upper Exe valley. These cheeses
                            look and taste fantastic. It
                            has a taste of fresh lemon and a hint of goats' milk. </td>

                        <p><strong>Devon Blue Cheese</strong> is made from cows’ milk from a local farmers’ co-operative
                            We source our cows’ milk from a farmers’ co-operative which gathers milk from several farms
                            in our local area. We make Devon Blue all year round, fitting in the production around the
                            goat and sheeps’ milk. The cows on the local farms are predominately Friesian Holsteins and
                            all are within 10 miles of the Dairy. Devon Blue is our best selling cheese. It is renowned
                            for its creamy, rich and buttery taste, as well as having an incredibly unique crumbly
                            texture. Devon Blue is one of our newer cheeses, being first produced in the late 1980’s by
                            Robin Congdon.

                        <p><strong>Mozzarella </strong>, a traditionally southern Italian cheese made from Italian
                            buffalo's milk by the pasta filata method. Mozzarella received a Traditional Specialities
                            Guaranteed certification from the European Union in 1998.
                            Mild, refreshing and supple, this Mozzarella gets its flavours from either cow or buffalo
                            milk. It has a springy and dense consistency with a light and barely discernible aroma of
                            wholesome cream, making it a favourite among audiences with delicate palates. Softly spoken
                            when fresh, the profile changes once melted, becoming stringy and mellow in flavour.
                            The white gold of Italy, Mozzarella hails from Campania near the Gulf of Naples. Beneath
                            hillsides and the resting Mount Vesuvius, milk from the Mediterranean buffalo produced a
                            rich cheese that soon became a favourite among those who tried it. Enjoyed in a wide range
                            of uses since then, it pairs beautifully with freshly picked basil and tomatoes. For warm
                            dishes, torn Mozzarella spreads evenly and melts the best.

                                <summary><em>How is Made?</em></summary>
                                Modern techniques can only get you so far. Thoroughly measuring the consistency by feel
                                and experience, artisans still rely purely on intuition and knowledge when deciding if
                                the Mozzarella is at the right stage of development.
                                As per tradition, production of Buffalo Mozzarella begins with either pasteurised or raw
                                milk with nothing but rennet added. This coagulates the milk and produces a firm paste.
                                Once the milk has curdled, it is cut and the remaining whey is left to strain off.
                                Resting the curds also promotes a rich flavour and texture. After final separation and
                                grating, the broken curd is dropped in hot water and heated to form a stringy paste.
                                Workers carefully stretch and knead the cheese to prevent holes and irregularities in
                                the body. As the consistency gradually strengthens, the surface of the cheese smooths
                                until it reaches a shiny gloss, at which point the artisan forms the Mozzarella much
                                like a baker would a bun.

                        Is a relatively hard, off-white (or orange if colourings are added), sometimes sharp-tasting,
                        natural cheese.
                        Originating in the English village of <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheddar,_Somerset"

                            target="_blank"> Somerset</a>,
                        cheeses of this style are now produced beyond the region and in several countries around the
                        world.
                        Cheddar is the most popular type of cheese in the UK, accounting for 51% of the country's £1.9
                        billion annual cheese market. It is the second-most popular cheese in the
                        US (behind mozzarella), with an average annual consumption of 10 lb (4.5 kg) per capita. The US
                        produced approximately 3,000,000,000 lb (1,300,000 long tons; 1,400,000 tonnes)
                        in 2014, and the UK 258,000 long tons (262,000 tonnes) in 2008. The term cheddar cheese is
                        widely used, but has no protected designation of origin within the European Union. However,
                        in 2007 a Protected Designation of Origin, "West Country Farmhouse Cheddar",
                        was created and only Cheddar produced from local milk within <A

                        Outside of Europe, the style and quality of cheeses labelled as cheddar may vary greatly, with
                        some processed cheeses being packaged as "cheddar" while bearing little resemblance.

                        The key ingredient for this unique cheddar is the highest quality rich milk sourced from dairy
                        cows that graze the lush pastures of the surrounding countryside.
                        The cheese is made to traditional methods (known as cheddaring) by a highly skilled team of
                        cheesemakers. Each stage of the process is performed by hand,
                        from the turning of the curds to the wrapping of each truckle in cheesecloth coated in lard.
                        The Cheddars are then taken to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wookey_Hole_Caves"
                            target="_blank">Somerset Caves</a> , where the consistent temperature (11°C) and
                        humidity makes for a perfect environment for the cheese to mature naturally.
                        This also ensures they remain mouthwateringly moist and packed full of the distinctive, earthy
                        and nutty flavours of the Caves. If you like your cheddar extra strong,
                        then it needs to be matured for up to 15 months, but it’s certainly worth the wait for a fuller
                        flavour.

                        <strong>The Parmigiano Reggiano </strong> or <strong>Parmesan</strong> cheese as it is called in
                        English is considered to be among the top cheeses by cheese connoisseurs.
                        Today, it is produced by various producers. However, PDO designation states that for a cheese to
                        be called as Parmesan, it has to be produced from cows grazing on fresh grass and hay.
                        Cheeses mocking Parmigiano Reggiano are called as Parmesan or Italian hard cheese by producers
                        to avoid legal issues. Parmigiano Reggiano cheese is named after the provinces in which it is
                        made, namely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Parma" target="_blank">
                            Provinces of Parma</a>,
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggio_Emilia" target="_blank">Reggio Emilia</a> ,<a

                        True Parmesan cheese has a hard, gritty texture and is fruity and nutty in taste. Cheeses
                        mocking Parmesan or inferior Parmesan may have a bitter taste. Parmigiano Reggiano cheese is
                        mostly grated over pastas, used in soups and risottos. It is also eaten on its own as a snack.
                        The secret of parmesan's intense flavour lies in the fact that it's made with fragrant
                        unpasteurised milk and that the cheese is carefully matured over a long period. The cheeses are
                        matured for between 18 and 48 months, depending on the kind of cheese and the producer. The
                        result is a hard, honey-coloured cheese with a crumbly, almost crystalline texture.

                            Like <em>Parmigiano-Reggiano, Grana Padano</em> is a golden, hard-rind cheese made using
                            cow’s milk. The production region is much larger than that of the <u>King of Cheeses</u>,
                            and,
                            at nine months, the minimum aging requirement is more relaxed.
                            As a result, Grana Padano has a slightly sweeter, less-concentrated flavor than
                            Parmigiano-Reggiano. It is also more affordable.

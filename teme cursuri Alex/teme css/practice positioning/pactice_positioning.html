                Before jumping into the box model, it helps to understand how elements are displayed. 
                In Lesson 2 we covered the difference between block-level and inline-level elements.
                 To quickly recap, block-level elements occupy any available width, regardless of their
                  content, and begin on a new line. Inline-level elements occupy only the width their 
                  content requires and line up on the same line, one after the other. Block-level elements 
                  are generally used for larger pieces of content, such as headings and structural elements. Inline-level elements are generally used for smaller pieces of content, such as a few words selected to be bold or italicized.

                If you use a fixed header or footer, make sure there is room for it! 
                I put a <e class="special">margin-bottom</e> on the <e class="special">body</e>.
